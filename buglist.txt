Several function shave issues in the code:
1) isEmpty() always returns true, which should not be the case.
2) removeBack() does not remove nodes
3) removeFront() does not remove nodes
4) addBack() messes up the order.
5) Destructor has memory leaks.

I believe that there is only one actual bug in the code, which is that isEmpty always
returns true. This causes the other four stated errors. The remove functions do not remove because
they call isEmpty to see if there is anything to remove, and it says that there is nothing to remove. 
addBack() actually adds to the front because it thinks that the list is empty, so it uses the addFront() method instead
which if the list was actually empty, would be fine. Finally, there are memory leaks because the Destructor
calls one of the remove methods and, as aforementioned, these do not actually remove any nodes.
